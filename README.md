# OverTheWire: Bandit Challenge

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the **Bandit wargame** from [OverTheWire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

The Bandit challenge is designed for beginners who want to learn the basics of Linux commands, file manipulation, permissions, SSH, and more ‚Äî all through practical, hands-on puzzles.
